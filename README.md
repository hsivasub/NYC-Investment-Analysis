# NYC-Investment-Analysis
A data product was built to assist a real estate company to understand which zip codes are profitable for short term rentals within New York City. They have already decided to invest in Two Bedroom houses as they are found to be profitable. For this purpose, publicly available data from Zillow and AirBnB were used.


NOTE: For viewing the code along with the graphs, visit https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hsivasub/NYC-Investment-Analysis/blob/master/Profitability%20Analysis%20for%20Zipcodes%20in%20NewYork%20City.ipynb

I couldn't render the plotly plots on the GitHub repository and thus I have used nbviewer to show them.
